One measure of access to healthcare is preventable hospitalizations. Individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) depend on outpatient primary care to keep their conditions under control. With poor access to primary care, these individuals may be forced to travel far for their necessary care or simply deal with their condition until they experience an exacerbation and require hospitalization. These hospitalizations are considered preventable with proper access to appropriate outpatient care.

    "text": "Methods:\nTwo data sets were selected from the California Health and Human Services (CalHHS) website: “Rates of Preventable hospitalizations for selected conditions” and “Primary care shortage areas”. These data sets are open access and downloaded in .csv or .xlsx format and then imported to RStudio for processing. Both datasets were inspected using the “summary”, “head”, “tail”, “str” and “dim” functions for missing or implausible values. The data sets were then combined based on the variable “county”. Data wrangling was conducted removing “NA” values, as well as non-county summary values. The packages Tidyverse and Dplyr were used for data cleaning. Within each dataset, key variables were identified for analysis.\nIn the Preventable hospitalizations dataset, PQIDescription, count_ICD10, Population_ICD10, RiskAdjRate_ICD10 were identified. PQI is short for Prevention Quality Indicators, used by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to describe conditions or hospitalizaitons that could be prevented with high quality outpatient care. ICD10 codes represent specific medical diagnoses. Risk-Adjusted-Rates were calculated in this dataset by adjusting the rates accounting for differences in sex, age, and socioeconomic status of the different counties. The dataset also included composite measurements that combined observations for diabetes, acute preventable hospitalizations, chronic preventable hospitalizations, and overall preventable hospitalizations. Observations with “NA” for PQI description were removed. Count_ICD10 and Population_ICD10 were classified as “character” and needed to be converted to “integer” for analysis.\nFor the Primary care shortages dataset, the variables total population, total primary care provider count, population:provider ratio and the ratio score were selected and summarized by county. One county, Alpine, had 0 reported primary care providers. The population:provider ratio was then reported as “NA”. This was replaced with 17,000 to match the maximum observed population:provider ratio in the dataset. Primary care provider shortage scores were categorized on a scale of 0-5, with 0 representing minimal shortage of primary care providers and 5 representing the greatest shortage of primary care providers. Specifically, the population:provider ratio for 0 is 0-1000; population:provider ratio for 1 is 1000-1500; 2 is 1500-2000; 3 is 2000-2500; 4 is 2500-3000; 5 is &gt;3000.\nIn the Exploratory Data analysis ggplot2 and kable were used for data exploration and visualization. Key variables were compared with known population data of each county. It was noted that the preventable hospitalization set included a “statewide” observation, which was removed from analysis. In order to visualize the distribution of key variables, box plots and histograms were made of both sets.\n\nhosp20 &lt;- PrevHosp %&gt;% \n  select(!Count_ICD9:RiskAdjRate_ICD9) %&gt;% \n  select(!AnnotationCode:AnnotationDesc) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2020) %&gt;% \n  filter(County != \"STATEWIDE\") %&gt;% \n  filter(!PQIDescription %in% c(\"Overall Composite\", \"Acute Composite\", \"Chronic Composite\", \"Diabetes Composite\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Count_ICD10 = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", Count_ICD10))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Population_ICD10 = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", Population_ICD10))) %&gt;% \n  rename(county = County)\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `Population_ICD10 = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\",\n  Population_ICD10))`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

Acute composite is made up of community acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection admissions rates.\n\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics:\nhospoverall &lt;- hospcomposite %&gt;% \n  filter(PQIDescription == \"Overall Composite\")\n\nresult_table &lt;- hospoverall %&gt;%\n  group_by(county) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Average_RiskAdjRate = mean(RiskAdjRate_ICD10, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Average_Provider_Score = mean(Average_Score_Provider, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Average_RiskAdjRate)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nkable(result_table, format = \"html\", caption = \"Counties Ordered by Highest Composite Risk-Adjusted Rates\",\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Adjusted Rate of Preventable Hospitalization\", \"Provider Shortage Score\"))\n\n\nCounties Ordered by Highest Composite Risk-Adjusted Rates\n\n\nCounty\nAdjusted Rate of Preventable Hospitalization\nProvider Shortage Score\n\n\n\n\nColusa\n1644.4\n3.7500000\n\n\nButte\n1466.2\n2.6250000\n\n\nGlenn\n1366.7\n3.0000000\n\n\nSutter\n1363.4\n3.3333333\n\n\nYuba\n1342.8\n3.6666667\n\n\nStanislaus\n1289.7\n2.5555556\n\n\nMerced\n1199.1\n1.8333333\n\n\nFresno\n1163.5\n3.0000000\n\n\nTehama\n1027.8\n4.0000000\n\n\nKings\n1022.7\n0.3333333\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresult_table_score &lt;- hospoverall %&gt;%\n  group_by(county) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Average_RiskAdjRate = mean(RiskAdjRate_ICD10, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Average_Provider_Score = mean(Average_Score_Provider, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Average_Provider_Score)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nkable(result_table_score, format = \"html\", caption = \"Top 10 Counties by Provider Score\",\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Adjusted Rate of Preventable Hospitalization\", \"Provider Shortage Score\"))\n\n\nTop 10 Counties by Provider Score\n\n\nCounty\nAdjusted Rate of Preventable Hospitalization\nProvider Shortage Score\n\n\n\n\nAlpine\n170.5\n5.000000\n\n\nTehama\n1027.8\n4.000000\n\n\nShasta\n963.9\n3.875000\n\n\nColusa\n1644.4\n3.750000\n\n\nYuba\n1342.8\n3.666667\n\n\nAmador\n766.1\n3.333333\n\n\nModoc\n650.1\n3.333333\n\n\nSutter\n1363.4\n3.333333\n\n\nTulare\n973.8\n3.222222\n\n\nEl Dorado\n866.1\n3.200000"

    "text": "Conclusions:\nThe top ten counties were taken in terms of adjusted rates of preventable hospitalization and provider shortage scores. Notable counties that appeared in the top 10 on both lists include Shasta, Colusa, Yuba, and Sutter. These four counties may represent target areas that experience both the highest rates of preventable hospitalization and the greatest primary care provider shortages.\nThese datasets had some noteworthy limitations. The Primary Care provider shortage dataset only included data from the year 2020, making it difficult to draw conclusions about any time-course. It would be interesting to see how the changes in primary care provider availability associate with changes in preventable hospitalizations. The Preventable hospitalizations dataset was also limited in its scope. More granular analysis of individual diagnoses by county was difficult due to low rates of hospitalization in some counties. For example, there were 0 hospitalizations due to asthma in young adults in several of the smaller counties in 2020.\nPreventable hospitalizations indicate areas of improvement in public health, particularly in access to care. These data show a positive association between shortage of primary care providers and preventable hospitalization rates. Greater investment in primary care, particularly in areas of shortage, can potentially improve these rates and citizens’ overall health.\nLinks to Datasets and Data Dictionaries:\nPrimary Care Shortage Areas:\n\nhttps://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/primary-care-shortage-areas-in-california/resource/0ba7c904-2302-400a-ba27-b8e8e5c1ab4a\n\nPreventable Hospitalizations:\n\nhttps://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/rates-of-preventable-hospitalizations-for-selected-medical-conditions-by-county/resource/1f699c45-f52f-408e-a8f2-87e537aea82d?inner_span=True"
